## Course Description
- Introduction to coding, with focus on Python. Study of basic structural elements such as lists, if statements, dictionaries, loops, functions, and classes. Consideration of how to apply these concepts to research in humanities and social sciences, and project-based learning. Students discover how to manage and display data with added impact. Content and goals are guided by freedom to research more effectively and freedom of speech. Letter grading.

## Project Ideas
- In terms of the data processing aspect of this class, I think it would be really interesting to manual create parsing software. Depending on the scope that I would want to make it, the user could perhaps input specific criteria that they want to filter a certain data set by (parameters into a function) and the program would output the data filtered accordingly. I'm not sure exactly what sort of data processing we will be doing in this class but I think manually creating this functionality would help better my understanding of elementry data science.

## Objectives for DGT HUM 140
- I've not had any formal teaching or study when it comes to learning Python. Most of my past experience has just been through doing side projects or watching youtube videos. I think to better my skills in this language, I would need more of a formal teaching on how the language operates. I hope to gain more knowledge on the core fundamentals and roots of programming in Python such that I can learn to utilize this dynamic language in a much more elegant and powerful way.
