    "    \"Adam Sandler gets a bad rap, especially in comedy circles. I am a huge fan, but even I won't deny that he's made some really terrible movies, that he probably knew were terrible, but is wanting to get paid such a crime? The truth is, while he has had a number of stinkers in the last few years, he's also had some really great films, which in my opinion are on the level with Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, Grown Ups is one such film.\",\n",
    "    \"At first glance and after watching the first 15 minutes, one may think this is just another cute girls doing cute things type of movie, but contrary to popular belief this movie is anything but that. This movie is a great movie for anyone in the family, I watched this movie with my 4 kids and everyone enjoyed it thoroughly. One scene that I found especially hilarious was the buff guy from Saskatchatoon, it was a funny and well timed joke, but it felt awfully derivative of a similar joke made in the Love Live! Party discord server.\",\n",
    "    \"The reason this wasn't nominated for the Oscars is because this film is too powerful, too captivating, and too prolific that it simply wouldn't be fair to have this movie contend with any others, it would simply win Best Picture. The jokes in this film are absolutely hilarious and hold a mirror to society on how each of our truest natures usually can be. Although on the outside we may be everyday average Joes/Jos working at a 9-5 pace, deep down we are animals born to be free.\",\n",
    "    \"I think it was a great movie.. Fun to watch with family… Also some of my favorite actors working together. A lot of people give Adam Sandler a lot of hate on his movies and say they aren’t that good but I love most of his work, call me crazy if you want but I even had his music CD with the song red hooded sweatshirt playing over and over… I definitely can’t complain.\",\n",
    "    \"Okay unpopular opinion has arrived. Adam Sandler can be incredibly funny, a lot of his movies are incredibly funny, this movie is unfortunately only sometimes funny. The first problem with this movie would have to be theirs no plot. A couple of friends and their families go on vacation at a lake house after their old couch dies and that's it.\",\n",
    "    \"Definitely a MUST WATCH film from 2019, this Palme d’Or winner of Cannes Film Festival sure does not disappoint with it’s hard hitting themes and exceptionally crafted story. The great use of space in the film coupled with well executed direction is what makes the film flow with such ease and keeps the audience engaged and emotionally invested from start to finish.\",\n",
    "    \"Parasite really is the kind of remarkable experience that makes modern movie-going/Binge-watching such a joy. South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho already has an impeccable track record, but he's stepped up his game with this brilliant, powerfully revealing social satire.The film had its world premiere at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival on 21 May.It was released in South Korea on 30 May 2019.Described by its creator as “a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains”, Parasite is more Shakespearean than Hitchockian – a tale of two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, told with the trademark genre-fluidity that has seen Bong’s back catalogue slip seamlessly from murder mystery, via monster movie, to dystopian future-fantasy and beyond.\",\n",
    "    \"Filming a movie is like painting a picture, you need to put time and effort into it and boy the people who worked on this film knew what there doing. Parasite is a South Korean Black Comedy Crime Thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho who also directed The Host (2006), Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), It first premiered at the Film Festival in Cannes where it won the Palme d'Or and most notably became the first film from a foreign country to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, I gotta a film like this definitely deserve those achievements.\",\n",
    "    \"I had no expectations walking into Parasite, but now my love and appreciation for it has breached the stratosphere. This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic.It's directed by Bong Joon-ho, he did Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), and now he's back with Parasite and it is fantastic. From a directing standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. The cinematography is extremely well done. It's just stunning and so metaphorical. There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat.\",\n",
    "    \"Parasite is highly intriguing and thrilling with a lot of action happening throughout its running time. No wonder this black comic thriller won numerous awards, including the prestigious Oscar for The Best Film, The Best Director and so on.All characters are aptly chosen and they live up to the expectations of the director. Their facial expressions are remarkable, whether if its in the scenes with lighter moments or more terrifying ones in the second half. For those who cannot understand the language in which it was made (Korean), the well translated subtitles come in handy!\"\n",
